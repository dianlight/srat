## Summary of Implementation: Handle Removed Disks Feature

I have successfully implemented the functionality to handle mounted disks that are physically removed from the system. Here's what the implementation does:

### Key Features:

1. **Automatic Detection**: The system now automatically detects when a previously mounted disk is no longer present in the system.

2. **Share Cleanup**: When a removed disk is detected, any shares associated with the mount point are automatically disabled.

3. **Safe Unmounting**: If the mount point is still mounted according to the OS, a lazy unmount is performed to safely unmount the volume.

4. **Issue Tracking**: An issue is automatically created to notify administrators about the removed disk.

5. **Graceful Fallback**: If lazy unmount fails, the system attempts a force unmount as a fallback.

### Implementation Details:

#### New Method: `HandleRemovedDisks`

- **Location**: `backend/src/service/volume_service.go`
- **Purpose**: Checks for mount points in the database that reference devices no longer available in the current system
- **Integration**: Called automatically during each `GetVolumesData()` execution

#### How It Works:

1. **Data Collection**: Gets all mount points from the database and creates a map of currently available devices from `GetVolumesData()`
2. **Comparison**: Compares stored mount points against currently available devices
3. **Device Matching**: Checks multiple device path formats (`sda1`, `/dev/sda1`) for compatibility
4. **Cleanup Process**:
   - Disables any shares for the missing device's mount point
   - Checks if the path is still mounted using `osutil.IsMounted()`
   - Performs lazy unmount if the path is still mounted
   - Attempts force unmount if lazy unmount fails
   - Removes the mount point directory if unmount succeeds
   - Creates an issue to notify about the removed disk

#### Error Handling:

- Non-critical errors are logged but don't stop the main operation
- The system continues to function even if cleanup partially fails
- Database consistency is maintained

#### Safety Features:

- Uses lazy unmount by default to avoid disrupting running processes
- Only attempts force unmount as a last resort
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation when operations fail

### Usage:

The feature works automatically - no user intervention required. When `GetVolumesData()` is called (which happens regularly), the system will:

1. Check for removed disks
2. Clean up associated shares
3. Safely unmount orphaned mount points
4. Create issues for administrator notification

### Benefits:

- **Prevents Stale Mounts**: Automatically cleans up mount points for removed devices
- **Share Consistency**: Ensures shares don't point to non-existent mount points
- **System Stability**: Prevents issues from accumulating over time
- **Administrative Awareness**: Creates issues so admins are notified of changes
- **Graceful Handling**: Uses safe unmount procedures to avoid data loss

The implementation is now complete, tested, and ready for production use.
