# SMB over QUIC Implementation - Summary

## Issue Reference
- **Issue**: #227
- **Feature**: SMB over QUIC transport protocol support

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All components have been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Components

1. **Settings DTO** (`backend/src/dto/settings.go`)
   - Added `SMBoverQUIC *bool` field with default value `true`
   - Uses pointer to allow nil (optional field)

2. **System Capabilities DTO** (`backend/src/dto/system_capabilities.go`)
   - New DTO to report system capabilities
   - Currently reports QUIC kernel module support

3. **Kernel Module Detection** (`backend/src/internal/osutil/osutil.go`)
   - New `IsKernelModuleLoaded(moduleName string)` function
   - Reads `/proc/modules` to detect loaded kernel modules
   - Includes comprehensive tests

4. **System API Handler** (`backend/src/api/system.go`)
   - New `GET /api/capabilities` endpoint
   - Checks for `quic` or `net_quic` kernel modules
   - Returns `SystemCapabilities` with `supports_quic` field

5. **Samba Configuration Template** (`backend/src/templates/smb.gtpl`)
   - Conditional QUIC configuration block
   - When enabled, sets:
     - `server smb3 encryption = mandatory`
     - `smb3 unix extensions = no`
     - `smb ports = 443`

6. **Tests**
   - `backend/src/api/setting_test.go`: Test for SMBoverQUIC setting
   - `backend/src/api/system_test.go`: Test for capabilities endpoint
   - `backend/src/internal/osutil/osutil_test.go`: Kernel module detection tests

### Frontend Components

1. **API Integration** (`frontend/src/store/sratApi.ts`)
   - Added `smb_over_quic?: boolean` to Settings type
   - Added `SystemCapabilities` type
   - Added `getApiCapabilities` query endpoint
   - Added `useGetApiCapabilitiesQuery` hook
   - **Note**: Manually updated due to RTK Query codegen issue with tuple types

2. **Settings UI** (`frontend/src/pages/settings/Settings.tsx`)
   - Added SMB over QUIC switch with proper type guards
   - Switch is disabled when:
     - System is read-only
     - Capabilities are loading
     - System doesn't support QUIC
   - Shows informative message when QUIC is not supported

3. **Tests** (`frontend/src/pages/settings/__tests__/Settings.test.tsx`)
   - Added test for `useGetApiCapabilitiesQuery` import

### Documentation

1. **Feature Documentation** (`docs/SMB_OVER_QUIC.md`)
   - Comprehensive guide covering:
     - Overview and features
     - System requirements
     - Configuration instructions
     - Client setup (Windows/Linux)
     - Troubleshooting
     - Security considerations
     - API reference

2. **CHANGELOG** (`CHANGELOG.md`)
   - Added feature entry with issue reference

3. **README** (`README.md`)
   - Added link to SMB over QUIC documentation

4. **Known Issue Documentation** (`frontend/RTK_QUERY_CODEGEN_ISSUE.md`)
   - Documented RTK Query codegen limitation
   - Explained workaround for manual API updates

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### RTK Query Code Generator

**Issue**: `bun run gen` fails with tuple type error

**Root Cause**: Pre-existing issue where Huma generates `type: ['array', 'null']` for nullable arrays, which RTK Query codegen cannot handle.

**Workaround**: Manual updates to `frontend/src/store/sratApi.ts` (already applied)

**Impact**: None - Frontend builds successfully and all tests pass

**Note**: This is a codebase-wide issue affecting many endpoints, not specific to SMB over QUIC

## Verification

### Backend
```bash
cd /workspaces/srat/backend
make test_build  # ✅ Builds successfully
make test        # ✅ All tests pass
make gen         # ✅ Generates OpenAPI docs
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd /workspaces/srat/frontend
bun run build    # ✅ Builds successfully
bun test         # ✅ All tests pass
bun gen          # ⚠️ Fails (known issue, workaround applied)
```

## Testing Summary

- ✅ Backend compiles without errors
- ✅ Frontend builds without errors
- ✅ Backend tests pass (31.7% coverage for API package)
- ✅ Frontend tests pass (16/16 tests, 64.62% function coverage)
- ✅ OpenAPI documentation generated successfully
- ✅ Code follows established patterns and conventions

## Database Schema

**Status**: Auto-handled by GORM

The `smb_over_quic` setting is stored in the `properties` table via GORM's property repository pattern. No migration needed as the table structure doesn't change - new properties are added dynamically.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced QUIC Detection**: Could add checks for QUIC kernel capabilities beyond just module presence
2. **Client Configuration Helper**: Could provide copy-paste commands for Windows/Linux clients
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Could track performance metrics when QUIC is enabled vs disabled
4. **Fix RTK Query Codegen**: Long-term, fix tuple type generation in OpenAPI spec

## Conclusion

The SMB over QUIC feature is **fully implemented and ready for use**. Despite the `bun gen` error (pre-existing codebase issue), all functionality works correctly:

- System automatically detects QUIC support
- UI properly enables/disables the feature based on system capabilities
- Samba configuration automatically adjusts when QUIC is enabled
- Comprehensive documentation guides users through setup and troubleshooting

The feature successfully addresses issue #227 and provides users with a modern, high-performance transport option for SMB.
