# Changelog

## [ üöß Unreleased ]

### üîÑ Breaking Changes

- **Rollbar v3.0.0-beta.4 Migration**: Updated Rollbar session replay configuration from `recorder` to `replay` to align with Rollbar.js v3.0.0-beta.4. This is an internal configuration change that does not affect end users.

### üîß Maintenance

- **Dependency Cleanup**: Replaced deprecated `github.com/inconshreveable/go-update` library (last updated 2016) with standard Go library functions for binary updates. This reduces external dependencies and improves maintainability without affecting functionality.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Reduced Database Dependencies [#208](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/208)**: Optimized CLI command database requirements:
  - **version command**: No database needed - runs without any DB initialization
  - **upgrade command**: Uses in-memory database by default - no file path required
  - **start/stop commands**: Continue to require persistent database file
  - Improved startup performance for version checks
  - Simplified command-line usage for common operations
- **SMB over QUIC Support [#227](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/227)**: Added comprehensive support for SMB over QUIC transport protocol with intelligent system detection:
  - **Samba Version Check**: Requires Samba 4.23.0 or later for QUIC support
  - **Kernel Module Detection**: Automatically detects QUIC kernel module (`quic` or `net_quic`) availability
  - **Enhanced System Capabilities API**: `/api/capabilities` now reports detailed QUIC support status including:
    - Overall QUIC support status
    - Kernel module availability
    - Samba version and sufficiency
    - Detailed unsupported reason when unavailable
  - **Smart UI Integration**: Settings page switch with:
    - Automatic disable when requirements not met
    - Tooltip showing specific missing requirements
    - Warning message explaining why QUIC is unavailable
  - **Automatic Samba Configuration**: When enabled, applies mandatory encryption, port 443, and disables Unix extensions
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed troubleshooting for Samba upgrades and kernel module loading
- **Auto-Update Service**: Implemented a backend service for automatic updates from GitHub releases, with support for multiple channels and local development builds.
- **Telemetry Configuration**: Added UI in Settings to configure telemetry modes, dependent on internet connectivity.
- Manage `recycle bin`option for share
- Manage WSDD2 service
- Manage Avahi service
- Veto files for share not global [#79](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/79)
- Ingress security validation [#89](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/89)
- Dashboard
- Frontend: Async console.error callbacks & React hook ‚Äî added a registry to register callbacks executed asynchronously whenever `console.error` is called, plus `useConsoleErrorCallback` hook for easy integration in components.
- **Enhanced TLog Package [#152](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/152)**: Complete logging system overhaul with advanced formatting capabilities:
  - Added support for `github.com/k0kubun/pp/v3` for enhanced pretty printing
  - Integrated `samber/slog-formatter` for professional-grade log formatting
  - Enhanced error formatting with structured display and tree-formatted stack traces for `tozd/go/errors`
  - Automatic terminal detection for color support
  - Sensitive data protection (automatic masking of passwords, tokens, API keys, IP addresses)
  - Custom time formatting with multiple preset options
  - Enhanced context value extraction and display
  - HTTP request/response formatting for web applications
  - Comprehensive color support with level-based coloring (TRACE=Gray, DEBUG=Cyan, INFO=Green, etc.)
  - Thread-safe configuration management
  - Backward compatibility maintained with existing code
- Manage `local master` option (?)
- Add Rollbar telemetry service for error tracking and monitoring
- Help screen or overlay help/tour [#82](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/82)
- Smart Control [#100](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/100)
- HDD Spin down [#101](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/101)

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Mount Creation and Update Retry Logic [#221](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/221)**: Fixed "Error creating mount from ha_supervisor: 400" when systemd unit already exists or has a fragment file. The supervisor service now automatically attempts to remove stale mounts and retry creation/update when encountering a 400 error. Extended fix includes:
  - Retry logic for both create and update operations
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all edge cases
  - Handles stale systemd units in all mount scenarios
  - See `/docs/ISSUE_221_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed analysis

- `enable`/`disable` share functionality is not working as expected.
- Renaming the admin user does not correctly create the new user or rename the existing one; issues persist until a full addon reboot.
- Fix dianlight/hassio-addons#448 [SambaNAS2] Unable to create share for mounted volume
- Fix dianlight/hassio-addons#447 [SambaNAS2] Unable to mount external drive
- **Disk Stats Service**: Changed log level from `Error` to `Warn` for disk stats update failures to reduce log noise and better distinguish between critical errors and warnings
- **SQLite concurrency lock (SQLITE_BUSY) resolved [#164](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/164)**: Hardened database configuration to prevent intermittent "database is locked" errors when reading mount points under concurrent load. Changes include enabling WAL mode, setting `busy_timeout=5000ms`, using `synchronous=NORMAL`, and constraining the connection pool to a single open/idle connection. Added repository-level RWMutex guards and a concurrency stress test.
- Addon protected mode check [#85](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/85)

### üèó Chore

- **Dependency Cleanup [#16](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/16)**: Removed abandoned `github.com/m1/go-generate-password` dependency (last updated April 2022) and replaced with custom implementation using Go's standard `crypto/rand` library. The new `GenerateSecurePassword()` function provides cryptographically secure random passwords with no external dependencies.
- Implement watchdog
- Replace snapd osutil dependency with internal mount utilities based on moby/sys/mountinfo <!-- cspell:disable-line -->
- Align UI elements to HA [#81](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/81)
- Create the base documentation [#80](https://github.com/dianlight/srat/issues/80)
- Display version from ADDON
