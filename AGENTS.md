# Agents

This document provides an overview of the agents and automated systems used in the SRAT project development and operation.

> **Important**: All coding agents must read and follow the instructions in [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) before making any changes to the codebase. Additionally, agents should consult the specialized instruction files in [`.github/instructions/`](.github/instructions/) for language-specific and task-specific guidance.

## Reading Copilot Instructions

Before any code modification task, agents **must**:

1. Read [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for the complete set of non-negotiable rules
2. Read the relevant specialized instruction files from [`.github/instructions/`](.github/instructions/):
   - [`go.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/go.instructions.md) - Go back-end development
   - [`reactjs.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/reactjs.instructions.md) - React frontend development
   - [`python.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/python.instructions.md) - Python/Home Assistant integration
   - [`backend_test.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/backend_test.instructions.md) - back-end testing
   - [`fontend_test.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/fontend_test.instructions.md) - Frontend testing
   - [`markdown.instructions.md`](.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md) - Markdown documentation

## Coding Agents

The SRAT project utilizes various coding agents and tools to assist with development, testing, and maintenance:

### GitHub Copilot

- **Purpose**: AI-powered code generation and assistance
- **Usage**: Integrated into VS Code for real-time code suggestions, refactoring, and documentation
- **Configuration**: See [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) for project-specific guidelines
- **Languages Supported**: Go (back-end), TypeScript/React (frontend), Python (Home Assistant)
- **Required Reading**: All agents must read and follow the copilot instructions before any code changes

### Pre-commit Hooks

- **Purpose**: Automated code quality checks before commits
- **Tools Included**:
  - `gosec`: Security scanning for Go code
  - Formatters: `gofmt`, `biome` for frontend
  - Linters: `govet`, `testifylint`
- **Configuration**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Installation**: Run `prek install` in the repository root

### Build Agents

- **Purpose**: Automated building and testing
- **back-end**: Uses `make` targets in `backend/Makefile` with Air for hot reload
- **Frontend**: Bun-based build system with watch mode
- **CI/CD**: Integrated with GitHub Actions for multi-arch builds (amd64, aarch64)

## Service Agents

### back-end Services

The Go back-end implements several service agents for Samba administration:

- **Share Service**: Manages Samba shares configuration
- **User Service**: Handles user management and authentication
- **System Service**: Provides system information and control
- **Telemetry Service**: Optional Rollbar integration for error reporting
- **Dirty State Service**: Tracks data changes for real-time updates

### Frontend Agents

- **RTK Query**: Manages API state and caching
- **Material-UI**: Component library for consistent UI
- **SSE Client**: Handles Server-Sent Events for real-time notifications

## Development Workflow Agents

### Testing Agents

- **back-end**: `testify/suite` with `mockio/v2` for unit and integration tests
- **Frontend**: bun:test + React Testing Library for component tests
- **HTTP Testing**: `humatest` for API endpoint validation

### Documentation Agents

- **OpenAPI Generation**: Autogenerated from Go code using Huma framework
- **Markdown Validation**: `markdownlint` and link checking
- **Changelog**: Automated CHANGELOG.md updates

## Deployment Agents

### Home Assistant Integration

- **Addon Configuration**: JSON-based configuration for Home Assistant supervisor
- **Database**: Embedded SQLite with GORM ORM
- **Service Management**: Oversees Samba service lifecycle

## Security Agents

- **Dependency Scanning**: `gosec` for Go dependencies
- **Vulnerability Checks**: Integrated into pre-commit and CI pipelines
- **Access Control**: Repository permissions and branch protection

## Monitoring and Telemetry

- **Logging Agent**: Custom `tlog` package with structured logging and sensitive data masking
- **Error Reporting**: Optional Rollbar integration with user consent
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in profiling support (see `PPROF.md`)

For more details on specific agents, refer to the relevant documentation files in the `docs/` directory or the main `README.md`.
