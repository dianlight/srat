Follow the Conventional Commits format strictly for commit messages.
Use the structure below:

```
<gitmoji> <type>[optional scope]: <description>\n\n[optional body]
```

Guidelines:

1. **Type and Scope**: Choose an appropriate type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and optional scope to describe the affected module or feature.
2. **Gitmoji**: Include a relevant `gitmoji` that best represents the nature of the change.
3. **Scope**: Chose an appropiate scope from `be`, `fe`, `doc` or mix with `+` (e.g. `fe+doc`)
3. **Description**: Write a concise, informative description in the header; use backticks if referencing code or specific terms.
4. **Body**: For additional details, use a well-structured body section:
   - Choose max 3 most important changes
   - Use bullet points (`*`) for clarity.
   - Clearly describe the motivation, context, or technical details behind the change, if applicable.
   - Max 60 char length for every bullet

Commit messages should be clear, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking.
