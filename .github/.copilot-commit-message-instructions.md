Follow the Conventional Commits format strictly for commit messages.
Use the structure below in the code block:

```plaintext
<gitmoji> <type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional closed issues]
[optional body]
```

Guidelines:

1. **Type and Scope**: Choose an appropriate type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and optional scope to describe the affected module or feature.
2. **Gitmoji**: Include always a relevant `gitmoji` that best represents the nature of the change.
3. **Scope**: Chose an appropiate scope from `be`, `fe`, `doc`,`ci` or mix with `+` (e.g. `fe+doc`)
4. **Description**: Write a concise, informative description in the header; use backticks if referencing code or specific terms.
5. **Body**: For additional details, use a well-structured body section:
   - Choose only very important changes and choose the top 3
   - Use bullet points (`-`) for clarity.
   - Clearly describe the motivation, context, or technical details behind the change, if applicable.
   - Max 60 char length for every bullet
6. **Closed issues**: Check for open issues related to changes and reference them

Commit messages should be clear, concise, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking.
Commit newer start with a code block.
