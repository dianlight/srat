# SRAT Copilot Instructions

These instructions are the concise, must-follow rules for working in SRAT. Keep changes minimal, readable, and aligned with existing patterns.

## Non‑negotiable rules

- **Read the file header first**: Always read the top comment/header of any file you modify; file‑specific rules override everything else.
- **No git writes**: Never run `git add/commit/push` unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Follow instruction files**: Use the specialized guidance in `.github/instructions/` for Go, Python, React, Markdown, and frontend tests.
- **Ask for clarification**: If a user request is ambiguous or could lead to unintended consequences, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- **Respect existing code**: Follow the established architecture, style, and patterns of the codebase. Avoid introducing new abstractions or styles unless necessary.
- **Prioritize maintainability**: Write clear, readable code that other developers can easily understand and maintain. Avoid clever or complex solutions when a straightforward approach will do.
- **Add tests**: When fixing bugs or adding features, include tests that cover the new behavior and edge cases. Follow the testing guidelines in the instruction files.
- **Test your changes**: Always run the relevant tests after making changes to ensure you haven't introduced regressions. Follow the testing guidelines in the instruction files.
- **Document your changes**: If your change affects the behavior of the system, update the relevant documentation and add comments to your code where necessary to explain non-obvious logic or decisions.

## Repo at a glance

- **Languages**: Go 1.26 back-end, TypeScript React frontend (Bun), Python 3.12+ Home Assistant integration.
- **Architecture**: API handlers → services → generated GORM helpers → SQLite (embedded). Frontend uses MUI + RTK Query. Custom component is WebSocket‑only.

## back-end (Go) essentials

- Use **context‑aware logging** (`slog.*Context`, `tlog.*Context`) when a real `context.Context` is already in scope. Never manufacture a context for logging.
- Go 1.26 rules: use `new(expr)` for pointer values, use `any` (not `interface{}`), use `WaitGroup.Go`, prefer `errors.AsType[T]` (standard library).
- Do **not** edit vendored code unless using the patch workflow (`backend/patches/` + `mise run //backend:patch`).

## Frontend essentials

- Use Bun toolchain (`frontend/`). Build outputs go to `backend/src/web/static`.
- **Do not** edit `frontend/src/store/sratApi.ts` or `backend/docs/openapi.*` directly—update Go and run `cd frontend && bun run gen`.
- MUI Grid: use the `size` prop (Grid2 default).

## Custom component essentials (Home Assistant)

- Runtime data lives in `entry.runtime_data` (not `hass.data`).
- WebSocket‑only coordinator: `update_interval=None`.
- Sensors return `None` when unavailable.

## Build, generate, test (short list)

- **Back-end:** `mise run //backend:dev|build|test|format|gen`
- **Frontend:** `mise run //frontend:build|dev|lint|test|gen`
- **Custom component:** `mise run //custom_components:check|test|lint|format|typecheck`

## Testing rules (fast summary)

- **Bug fixes require a failing test first**, then the fix, then re‑run tests.
- Frontend tests: use `mise run //frontend:test`, React Testing Library, and **`user-event` only** (no `fireEvent`).
- Frontend test stability: run `mise run //frontend:test --rerun-each 10` for modified tests.

## Docs & quality gates

- Docs: `mise run docs-validate` (and `mise run docs-fix` when needed).
- Security: `mise run security`.

## Patching external Go libs

- Patches live in `backend/patches/`. Apply with `mise run //backend:patch`.
- Update vendor via `cd backend/src && go mod vendor` then re‑apply patches with `mise run //backend:patch`.

## Git Branch Naming Convention

When asked to generate a Git command or branch name from a Markdown task:

1.  Use prefixes: `feature/` for new items, `fix/` for bugs, `docs/` for documentation, and `refactor/` for code improvements.
    
2.  Convert the task title to "kebab-case" (lowercase, replace spaces/underscores with hyphens).
    
3.  Strip emojis, special characters, and common stop-words (a, the, of, for, with).
    
4.  Example: "Task: \[ \] Implement user login validation" -> `feature/implement-user-login-validation`.
    

## Contextual Awareness

*   **Markdown Authority**: Always treat "Implementation Notes" in `.md` files as the primary source of truth for business logic.
    
*   **Cross-Repo Logic**: If "Target Repo" is specified in the Markdown header, assume all code generation or terminal commands apply to that specific directory.
    
*   **Task Scanning**: When a user mentions a task by name, look for the corresponding checkbox in open Markdown files to understand the requirements.
