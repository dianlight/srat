SRAT (SambaNAS REST Administration Tool) is a new system designed to provide a simplified user interface for configuring SAMBA. It has been developed to work within Home Assistant, specifically for this addon, but can also be used in other contexts.

Currently under development and in an alpha state, SRAT is set to become the preferred system for configuring and using this addon, eventually "retiring" the YAML configuration.

:construction_worker:  This is a part for new SambaNas2 Home Assistant Addon. :construction_worker:

# Quick Start Demo

![Demo Preview](https://picsum.photos/1920/1080)

I believe that you should bring value to the reader as soon as possible. You should be able to get the user up and running with your project with minimal friction.

If you have a quickstart guide, this is where it should be.

Alternatively, you can add a demo to show what your project can do.

# Table of Contents

This is a table of contents for your project. It helps the reader navigate through the README quickly.
- [Project Title](#project-title)
- [Quick Start Demo](#quick-start-demo)
- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
- [Contribute](#contribute)
- [License](#license)


# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

> **Note**: For longer README files, I usually add a "Back to top" buttton as shown above. It makes it easy to navigate.

This is where your installation instructions go.

You can add snippets here that your readers can copy-paste with click:

```shell
gh repo clone navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme
```


# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Next, you have to explain how to use your project. You can create subsections under here to explain more clearly.

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You have people who want to use your project and then you have people who want contribute to your project.

This is where you provide instructions for the latter.

Add instructions on how to set up a development environment, clone, and build the project.

You can use the code snippets here as well:

```shell
command to clone your project
command to build your project
command to run your project in development mode
```

# Contribute
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You can use this section to highlight how people can contribute to your project.

You can add information on how they can open issues or how they can sponsor the project.
