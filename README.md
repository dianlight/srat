SRAT (SambaNAS REST Administration Tool) is a new system designed to provide a simplified user interface for configuring SAMBA. It has been developed to work within Home Assistant, specifically for this addon, but can also be used in other contexts.

Currently under development and in an alpha state, SRAT is set to become the preferred system for configuring and using this addon, eventually "retiring" the YAML configuration.
